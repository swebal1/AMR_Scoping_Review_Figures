The code for the following figures are including in this repo.

## Race, ethnicity and risk for colonisation and infection with key bacterial pathogens: a scoping review
### Bubble Plot

minority groups vs majority group, among 62 studies included in this scoping review.

Note: MRSA=Methicillin-resistant S. aureus. UTI=Urinary tract infection; SSTI=skin and soft. tissue infection.

### Map Plot
Depicts the study location for 62 studies describing individuals’ risk of colonisation or infection with priority pathogens by their racial or ethnic identity.
