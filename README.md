# AMR Scoping Review Figures
The visualizations below were published in two scoping reviews related to antimicrobial resistance and social determinants of health.
The code for the following figures are including in this repo.

## Race, ethnicity and risk for colonisation and infection with key bacterial pathogens: a scoping review
### Bubble Plot
Depicts the frequency of reports of priority bacterial pathogens or associated infections by racial or ethnic
minority groups vs majority group, among 62 studies included in this scoping review. Note: MRSA=Methicillin-resistant S. aureus. UTI=Urinary tract infection; SSTI=skin and soft. tissue infection.

The code for this figure is in the file, "bubble_plot.R" This was created using R version 4.4.3.

### Map Plot
Depicts the study location for 62 studies describing individuals’ risk of colonisation or infection with priority pathogens by their racial or ethnic identity.

The code for this figure is in the file, "race_map_plot.R" This was created using R version 4.4.3.

## Socioeconomic status and the risk for colonisation or infection with priority bacterial pathogens: a global evidence map
### Map Plot
Depicts the study locations for 50 studies describing individuals’ risk of colonisation or infection with priority pathogens by their socioeconomic status
